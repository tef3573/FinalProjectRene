## Project Rene

Project Rene is a biotech application that detects produce and food products. It will revolutionize the way users interact with food products during their shopping experiences. Utilizing an object detection model called YOLOv8, the system will identify grocery items and provide real-time, accurately trained calorie count and nutritional information directly to the user, ensuring confidence in the items purchased.
